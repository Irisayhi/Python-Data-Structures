Given that Python lists and Python tuples are quite similar - when might you prefer to use a tuple over a list?

: For a temporary variable that you will use and discard without modifying.

Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution 
by hour of the day for each of the messages. 
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time 
and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour.


My code:


name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)

count = dict()
hour_list = list()
for line in handle:
    if not line.startswith('From '):continue
    word = line.split()
    time = word[5]
    timelist = time.split(':')
    hour = timelist[0]
    hour_list.append(hour)

for hour in hour_list:
    count[hour] = count.get(hour,0) + 1
      
for k,v in sorted(list(count.items())):
    print(k,v)
