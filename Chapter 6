Assignment chapter 6:

6.5 Write code using find() and string slicing (see section 6.10) to extract the number at the end of the line below. 
Convert the extracted value to a floating point number and print it out.

My code: 

text = "X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475";
first = text.find('0')
last = text.find('5')
number = text[first:last+1]
print(float(number))


Prof's code:

pos1 = text.find(":")
print(text[pos1+1:])
print(float(text[pos1+1:]))
