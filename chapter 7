7.1 
Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, 
and print the contents of the file in upper case. Use the file words.txt to produce the output below.


My code: 

fname = input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
for line in fh:
    line = line.rstrip().upper()
    print(line)


7.2
Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, 
looking for lines of the form:

X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475

Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values 
and produce an output as shown below. 

Do not use the sum() function or a variable named sum in your solution.


My code: 

fname = input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
total = 0
count = 0
for line in fh:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith("X-DSPAM-Confidence:") :
        count = count + 1
        pos = line.find(':')
        number = float(line[pos+2:])
        total = total + number

average = total/count 
print('Average spam confidence:', average)
