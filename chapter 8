In-class Example: To get the average of inputted data

Method 1:

total = 0
count = 0
while True:
    number = input("Enter a number:")
    if number == 'done': break
    number = float(number)
    total = total + number
    count = count + 1
    
average = total/count
print('average is', average)


Method 2:

numlist = list()
while True:
    inp = input('Enter a number: ')
    if inp == 'done':break
    value = float(inp)
    numlist.append(value)

average = sum(numlist)/len(numlist)
print('Average', average)

Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, 
split the line into a list of words using the split() method.
The program should build a list of words. For each word on each line check 
to see if the word is already in the list and if not append it to the list. 
When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.

    word= line.split()    
    for element in word:          
        if element not in lst:         
            lst.append(element)  
print(sorted(lst))
